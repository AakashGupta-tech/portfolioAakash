            I recently graduated from SRM University. Currently I have been
            working on my skills on web development. I have done my 12th
            standard from the Aaryans School. During my graduation, I have gain
            a set of skills while working with people from different
            backgrounds. Most important thing that I have learned is how to work
            in a team and be a team player. I also have some experience in
            leading a team. I try to learn from my mistakes and improve my work.
            One thing I would say that is best about me is never stop learning.
            I constantly try to learn new and different things.
